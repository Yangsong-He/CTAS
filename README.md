Title: CTAS: A network control theory-based approach to identify key regulatory TFs of AS events during epithelial-mesenchymal transition Version: 1.0 Author:Yan Gan, Yangsong He yangsonghe03@gmail.com Maintainer: Yangsong He yangsonghe03@gmail.com Description: CTAS is a network control theory--based approach to identify key regulatory TFs of AS events during epithelial--mesenchymal transition(EMT). CTAS integrates pseudotime ordering, trend analysis, sparse directed network inference, and control-theoretic screening into a unified framework.
